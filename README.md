This game called RPG is inspired by games like DND (Dungeons and Dragons). It is a story telling game. I designed this project as a website. The GameServer class contains the main
file and in that class, I wrote a server from scratch. There are few rules about character classes. I wrote these rules or specifications in a webpage (characters.html) in the project.
Also I created a UML class diagram of the project, so everybody can understand the code easily. In addition to that I will continue to extend my UML diagrams. Last but not least
this project is a hobby project of me, that is why I implemented server from scratch, thus it could be some faults or errors in the server code.
The UML class diagram of the code:
